# NoUMD Rewrite
This plugin is the rewrite of the **NoUMD plugin** for PSP, which completely disables your PSP's UMD Drive. <br/><br/>
Tested on `6.39 PRO-C2`, `6.39 TN-A Xtended`, `6.60 PRO-C2`, `6.61 PRO-C2` and `6.61 ME 2.3`. It should work on **every 6.XX (L)ME, PRO and HEN firmware**. More feedback would be appreciated!
